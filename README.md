#### The Best of Calculus

This is, as it says, a book about the "best" of calculus.  I included a copy of the latest version of the pdf in this repo.

[from the Introduction]

This was supposed to be a short book, an exploration of problems like the volume of the cone and sphere, or even just the area of a circle, with some simple physics thrown in. These questions contain within them the heart of calculus: infinities both large and small. I imagine myself looking over Archimedes’ shoulder as he explains it to me.

I wrote many of the early chapters originally as short explanations for my son Sean as he studied calculus in high school. It bothers me that so often the good stuff gets left out — the ideas which make you go ... wow. Now, years later, I still find a lot of pleasure in trying to understand what Kepler and Newton did. It took a genius to figure it out the first time, but it is within anyone’s grasp to appreciate what they found...

#### Note on LaTeX

The files in this project are LaTeX files.  They can be typset individually to pdf (provided the graphics files are discovered), or the whole thing can be converted to one giant pdf.  To do this I run ``script.sh``, but to do this yourself, you will not only need a LaTeX distribution, you must also edit the hard coded paths.
