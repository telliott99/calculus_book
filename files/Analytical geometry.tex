It is difficult today to put ourselves in the place of those who tried to reason about mathematics through the ages.  

For example, the Greeks lacked algebra, and although the Romans worked with numbers they lacked decimal notation.  The concept of $0$ came much later (from India), and even in the Middle Ages there was as yet no such thing as the equals sign $=$, which dates from 1557.

The invention of analytic geometry is often ascribed solely to Descartes, but Fermat also had a big role.  There are two fundamental ideas.
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.45] {coordinates.png} \end{center}

The first is to orient two number lines on a piece of paper, at right angles, and then consider pairs of numbers $(x,y)$ in the 2D plane.  Such pairs or tuples are called points.

Descartes published this idea in 1637.  The presentation would be difficult to recognize as our current system, but the germ is there:  axes where the position of a variable could be marked.  Only the positive numbers would be shown, and the axes not necessarily perpendicular.  As to the proofs, here is wikipedia on the subject:

\begin{quote} \textcolor{blue}{His exposition style was far from clear, the material was not arranged in a systematic manner and he generally only gave indications of proofs, leaving many of the details to the reader.  His attitude toward writing is indicated by statements such as "I did not undertake to say everything," or "It already wearies me to write so much about it," that occur frequently. In conclusion, Descartes justifies his omissions and obscurities with the remark that much was deliberately omitted "in order to give others the pleasure of discovering [it] for themselves."}
\end{quote}

The second idea of analytic geometry is to plot all the points that satisfy some mathematic relationship between $x$ and $y$, for example the parabola $y=x^2$.  

To do this, pick a few values of $x$ and calculate the corresponding values of $y$.  For example:  $(0,0), (\pm 1,1), (\pm 2, 4), \dots$.  Plot these points, and then finally, sketch the graph of the curve, without actually trying to plot \emph{all} of the individual points (of which there is an infinite number).  We make the assumption here that the function being plotted is continuous, so that the sketch of a curve between two points that are close enough together will be fairly smooth and if the $x$-values are close to the plotted $x$, the corresponding $y$-values will not be not too different from the plotted $y$.

\subsection*{formulas for a line}

Suppose we pick two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, plot them on a graph, and then draw the line that connects them.  Recall Euclid's first two postulates:

$\circ$  A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.

$\circ$   Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.
 
Now we want to derive an equation that describes (is valid for) all the points or pairs of values $(x,y)$ on this line.  A general approach is to say that the line has some slope $m$, which is defined as the rate of change of $y$, called $\Delta y$, divided by the rate of change of $x$:

\[ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

This is the \emph{point-slope equation}.

The value of $m$ might be zero, for a horizontal line, where all the values of $y$ are the same.  Or it might be undefined, for a vertical line, where all the values of $x$ are identical.  

In most cases, however, $m \ne 0$ and $m \in (-\infty, \infty)$.  That is, $m$ is not infinite but also non-zero.

Except in the case of the vertical line, we can write
\[ y = mx + b \]

for any two points $x$ and $y$ on a given line.  $b$ is called the $y$-intercept, it is the value of $y$ obtained when $x = 0$.  This is the \emph{slope-intercept equation} of the line.

Notice that the equation of a line is not determined just by the slope.  One can draw a whole family of parallel lines with the same slope and different $y$-intercepts.  For example here are three lines $y = 2x + b$ for $b = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}$.

\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {line_family.png} \end{center}

The value of $x$ corresponding to $y = 0$ is the $x$ intercept
\[ x = -\frac{b}{m} \]

The first equation is easily derived from the second.  Plugging in specific values of $x$ and $y$ we have
\[ y_1 = mx_1 + b \]
\[ y_2 = mx_2 + b \]
Subtracting
\[ y_2 - y_1 = m(x_2 - x_1) \]
which rearranges to give the desired result.

\subsection*{formula for a circle}

A circle can be defined as all the points at the same distance from a central point, let us label that point $(h,k)$.  The distance from the points to the center is the radius, denoted $r$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the square of the distance from the origin as
\[ r^2 = (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 \]

The simplest circles are those whose central point is the origin of the coordinate system.  In that case the equation  simplifies to 
\[ r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \]
Usually, we know the value of $r$ and we want to write an equation for $y$ in terms of $x$.  Then
\[ y^2 = r^2 - x^2 \]
\[ y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2} \]

\subsection*{formula for a parabola}

A general formula for a parabola with its vertex at the point $(h,k)$ is
\[ y - k = a(x - h)^2 \]

where $a$ is called the shape factor.  It governs how steeply the curve rises (and by its sign, in which direction it opens).

Multiplying out:
\[ y - k = a(x^2 - 2xh + h^2) \]
\[ y = ax^2 - 2ah x + ah^2 + k \]

In this form the cofactors are usually simplified as
\[ y = ax^2 + bx + c \]

where
\[ b = -2ah; \ \ \ \ c = ah^2 + k \]

Probably the most common thing to do with a quadratic equation like this is to find the roots, the values of $x$ for which $y=0$ is a solution.  These are the points where the graph of the curve crosses the $x$-axis (if it does so at all).

\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

We can find a general formula by the process of \emph{completing the square}.  First, multiply through by $1/a$ and rearrange:
\[ x^2 + \frac{b}{a} x = - \frac{c}{a} \]

The key insight is to recognize that if we add $(b/2a)^2$ to both sides, the left-hand side will become a perfect square:
\[ x^2 + \frac{b}{a} x + (\frac{b}{2a})^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + (\frac{b}{2a})^2 \]
\[ (x + \frac{b}{2a})^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + (\frac{b}{2a})^2 \]
\[ x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{-\frac{c}{a} + (\frac{b}{2a})^2} \]

Multiplying top and bottom of the first term under the square root gives a common factor:
\[ x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{-\frac{4ac}{4a^2} + (\frac{b}{2a})^2} \]
which can come out of the square root and then matches what's in the second term on the left-hand side:
\[ x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{-4ac + b^2}}{2a} \]
which we rearrange slightly to give the standard \emph{quadratic formula}:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

\subsection*{focus and directrix}
There is a classic geometric definition of the parabola.  

Based on what we said above, without loss of generality, we can translate any parabola to the origin of coordinates, with equation $y = ax^2$, so let us just work with that.

Now, pick a point on the $y$-axis a distance $p$ up from the origin, colored magenta in the figure.  This point is called the focus.

Then draw a line parallel to the $x$-axis which intersects the $y$-axis the same distance $p$ below the origin.  This line is called the directrix.  It is colored red and is dashed.

\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {para16.png} \end{center}
The parabola consists of all those points whose distance to the focus is equal to the vertical distance to the directrix.

Pick an arbitrary point on the parabola (in blue), with coordinates $(x, ax^2)$.  The squared distance to the focus is 
\[ \Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2 = x^2 + (ax^2 - p)^2 \]

while the squared distance to the directrix is  $(ax^2 + p)^2$.  

For the correct choice of $p$ these distances will be equal:
\[ x^2 + (ax^2 - p)^2 = (ax^2 + p)^2 \]

We have $(m-n)^2$ on the left-hand side and $(m+n)^2$ on the right-hand side, so the result has $4mn$ on the right hand side:
\[ x^2 = 4apx^2 \]

Divide by $x^2$
\[ 1 = 4ap \]
\[ p = \frac{1}{4a} \]

The shape factor $a$ determines the distance of the focus from the origin, we label that distance as $p$.  The equation of the directrix is $y = -p$.

\subsection*{slope of the tangent}
We will see that the slope of the tangent to $y=ax^2$ at any fixed point $x_0$ is equal to $2ax_0$. 

This is literally the first result from differential calculus, but we will also see a way to find it using analytical geometry in the next chapter, as well as a vector approach later on.

Thus, the equation of a line passing through the point $(x_0,ax_0^2)$ with the given slope is
\[ y - ax_0^2 = 2ax_0(x - x_0) \]
and what \emph{that} means is that the $x$-intercept (the value of $x$ for which $y = 0$) of the line is:
\[ - ax_0^2 = 2ax_0 x - 2ax_0^2 \]
\[ ax_0^2 = 2ax_0 x \]
\[ x_0 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{x_0}{2} \]

The tangent line passes through the $x$ axis halfway back toward the origin.
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {para17.png} \end{center}

And what \emph{that} means is that the $y$-intercept is symmetrical with the original point (as far below the $x$-axis as the point is above it). Here's the algebra:
\[ y - ax_0^2 = 2ax_0(0 - x_0) \]
\[ y = -ax_0^2 \]

And then finally, if the point on the parabola is $P$, the focus $F$, the intersection with the directrix $D$, and the $y$-intercept $I$
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {para18.png} \end{center}
the quadrilateral $FPDI$ is a regular parallelogram with all equal sides.
